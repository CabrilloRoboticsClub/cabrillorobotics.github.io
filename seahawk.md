description:  "Seahawk is our second-generation ROV, designed for the MATE ROV competition. Building on lessons learned from our first ROV, Hydrozoa, we developed a completely new vehicle with more time and resources. While we kept the modular research-style frame for its adaptability, we made significant improvements.<br>We upgraded from a 4-thruster to an 8-thruster system, giving us 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) control. We also added a power box and expanded our power budget with new electronics. To enhance our tooling capabilities, we built a custom pneumatics manifold, as servos proved unreliable in previous designs. On the software side, we improved camera feeds and transitioned from ROS1 to ROS2 for better performance.<br>One challenge with the Seahawk was its overly modular design, which occasionally led to additional failures. Despite this, it was a major improvement over Hydrozoa and served its purpose well in competition."
