description: "Cabrillo College’s Robotics Club recently announced their participation in the upcoming RoboSub competition, following their victory at the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) World Championship. Last month, the team secured First Place in the most advanced category of the MATE competition, outperforming 29 teams from 9 countries. MATE tasks teams worldwide to design and construct a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), a tethered underwater robot, capable of performing simulated industry tasks. After three consecutive years of participation in the MATE competition, and three first place victories in their respective division, Cabrillo Robotics is ready to embark on a new challenge.

“We are incredibly grateful for our time participating in the MATE competition,” said Stephanie L’Heureux, Cabrillo Robotics President. “The experience has been invaluable, providing us with numerous technical and interpersonal skills we will carry forward into our careers as engineers. Over the years, we’ve learned to tackle complex engineering challenges by devising unique and innovative solutions, and work cohesively as a team. Moreover, our participation in MATE has inspired us to push our limits and continuously seek new challenges and learning opportunities–-which is why we have decided to take on a new challenge this year. MATE has provided us with a solid foundation for underwater robotics, and with that knowledge RoboSub competition appears to be a logical next step for us.”

Cabrillo Robotics' upcoming participation in RoboSub marks a significant step forward, as the team will now focus on developing Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Unlike ROVs, these AUVs operate independently, navigating the underwater environment without human intervention. The transition to building an AUV presents unique hardware and software challenges.
