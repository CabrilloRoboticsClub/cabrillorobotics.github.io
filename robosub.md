description: "RoboSub is an international robotics competition in which teams compete to create Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). These AUVs are completely unmanned, and must use sensor data to navigate and complete various tasks in a live competition. The competition tasks mirror real-world AUV missions, such as seafloor mapping and sonar localisation."
