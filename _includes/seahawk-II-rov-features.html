            ROV Features

                    <li><span class="feature">1</span> The propulsion system consists of eight strategically positioned Blue Robotics T200 thrusters encased in custom 3D-printed housings. The thrusters are arranged to enable six degrees of freedom. Input from the control system allows variable thrust to optimize precision. This design enables the robot to navigate complex environments with agility, crucial for delicate tasks like ecosystem restoration.</li>
                    <li><span class="feature">2</span> SeaHawk II is equipped with three tactically placed cameras which provide the pilot with a comprehensive view of the robot’s underwater environment.  The primary camera is mounted on a servo which allows the pilot to actively adjust the field of view. The camera at the back of the ROV permits reverse navigation, enhancing maneuverability. The downward facing camera gives the pilot an aerial view of the environment.</li>
                    <li><span class="feature">3</span> The articulating pneumatic claw is engineered for dynamic and reliable usage. It is mounted on the front of SeaHawk II, within view of the primary camera. The claw is pneumatically actuated by the custom manifold which is supplied air through the pneumatic tube in the tether. The versatile custom jaws of the tool enable SeaHawk II to retrieve and relocate a wide range of objects, from brain coral to acoustic receivers. </li>
                    <li><span class="feature">4</span> The multifunction rear claw was designed for lifting heavy loads and  deploying data collection devices, such as the irrigation system framework and the coastal pioneer array. With the claw bolted closely to the center of mass, heavy loads are easier to pick up. The claw is also specially shaped to allow for more precise motions, which aids itself to tasks such as the collection of sediment samples.</li>

                    <li><span class="feature">5</span> The ROV features a waterproof digital temperature sensor with accuracy of ±0.5°C with a range of -55 to 125°C. These temperature readings are collected every 0.1 seconds and displayed to the pilot dashboard. The task “Measure the temperature to check the SMART cable sensor readings'' requires accurate measurements to verify the functionality of a SMART repeater's temperature sensor.</li>
                    <li><span class="feature">6</span> The valve coupler is designed so that the ROV can interact with the valve on the irrigation device and complete the MATE 2024 task “Activate the irrigation system”. It is mounted to a custom quick release (6.a) for modularity enabling rapid swapping of various tooling. It was designed to interface with the valve’s geometry, all while providing a clear view of the rotation to the pilot. </li>
                    <li><span class="feature">7</span> Deploying submarine cables is a complicated action, for this reason a specialized cable deployment spool was designed to deploy Science Monitoring And Reliable Telecommunications (SMART) Subsea Cables  through waypoints. The SMART cable is round about the spool to prevent tangling during deployment and released by a motorized mechanism at a steady rate. This tool is also attached to the quick release.</li>
                    <li><span class="feature">8</span> The vertical profiling float (VPF) autonomously ascends and descends the water column collecting pressure data. Upon resurfacing, packets are transmitted via LoraWan Radio modules to the deckside. The data is plotted as a graph of depth in meters vs the sample time. GO-BGC floats also collect various data to gather observations of ocean biochemistry and ecosystems.</li>
