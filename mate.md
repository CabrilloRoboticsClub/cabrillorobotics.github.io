description: "The Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Competition challenges student teams from around the world to design and build Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). ROVs are tethered, piloted robots used for underwater exploration, data collection, and various service missions. Each year, the MATE competition introduces a new theme that reflects current real-world ROV applications, encouraging teams to innovate solutions that address present global needs.<br>The international competition gathers teams representing countries around the globe as far as Italy, Hong Kong, and Egypt. Teams demonstrate their ROV's functionality in a live product demonstration in which the robot must complete tasks that simulate real-world ROV applications. In addition, teams must justify their design choices through marketing strategies, comprehensive documentation, and a presentation--highlighting the multidisciplinary nature of engineering projects.<br>For additional information visit the <a href='https://materovcompetition.org/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>MATE Competition website</a>"
awards-subtitle: Three years competing, three first-place victories.
awards-description: "Cabrillo Robotics Club has demonstrated exceptional performance at the MATE ROV competition over their three years of participating. In 2022 and 2023, the team competed in the Pioneer division, a category primarily composed of community and technical colleges. ROVs <a href='https://cabrillorobotics.org/hydrozoa'>Hydrozoa (2022)</a> and <a href='https://cabrillorobotics.org/seahawk'>SeaHawk (2023)</a> each secured the top overall score in the division. In 2024, the club advanced to the competition's most advanced tier-- Explorer. This category is usually dominated by four-year universities with years of MATE experience. Through innovative engineering and dedication, <a href='https://cabrillorobotics.org/seahawk-II'>SeaHawk II (2024)</a> outcompeted 29 teams from around the globe taking home the All-Around Champion award."
