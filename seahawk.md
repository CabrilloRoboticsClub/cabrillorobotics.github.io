description:  "The SeaHawk is our second-generation ROV, engineered for participation in the 2024 MATE ROV competition. The ROV was built on lessons learned from our previous vehicle, Hydrozoa. With increased time and more resources at our disposal, Cabrillo Robotics Club set out to create a completely redesigned vehicle that prioritized modularity.<br>SeaHawk retained the research-style modular frame of Hydrozoa for its adaptability, but we made many advancements to all ROV systems. One of the most significant upgrades was the transition from a 4-thruster to an 8-thruster system, allowing us to achieve 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) control. This enhancement dramatically improved the vehicle's maneuverability and precision in underwater tasks. We also introduced a dedicated power box and expanded the power budget with upgraded electronics. To address tooling limitations, we designed and built a custom pneumatics manifold, replacing the previously unreliable servos. This change greatly enhanced our ability to manipulate objects and interact with the underwater environment.<br>On the software front, we implemented substantial improvements, including a major transition from ROS1 to ROS2. This upgrade enabled increased modularity, reliability, and maintainability in the software architecture, which was crucial for managing the increased complexity of the SeaHawk's systems.<br>SeaHawk's emphasis on modularity came with its own set of challenges. While the design allowed for a high degree of adaptability, it also introduced additional points of failure, requiring more maintenance and troubleshooting. Despite these setbacks, the Seahawk was a significant improvement over Hydrozoa and performed well in competition, ultimately securing First Place Overall in the Pioneer Division.<br>
